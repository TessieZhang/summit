                <h3>How part-time is different to full-time or casual</h3>
                <p>
                    Full-time employees work longer hours. On average, they work 38 hours per week.
                    Casual employees usually work irregular hours but they donâ€™t get paid sick leave or annual leave.
                    Part-time employees get the same minimum entitlements (such as sick leave and holiday leave) as a full-time employee, based on how many hours they work each week.

                <h3>Part-time Worker Consultation</h3>
                <p>
                    A safe workplace is more easily achieved when employers and employees talk to each other about potential problems and work together to find solution. Employees can be consulted in a variety of ways, including by setting up a health and safety committee or by holding regular meetings.
