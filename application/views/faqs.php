										<p>Safe at Part-Time Job (safe@PTJ) provides an industry-wide snapshot of how people get injured and what can be done to prevent these injuries. 
										The website extracts statistics from WorkSafe and aims to obtain valuable information for part-time workers. 
										The application represents potential risks at work, prevention of injury, first aid after injury and recovery, average wages, and part-time employee rights.

										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>The safe@PTJ represent WorkSafe claims lodged over the past three years, showing where workers have commonly been hurt and how. The solutions are created by WorkSafe from data and experience, and show the typical level of safe controls a WorkSafe inspector would expect to see in workplaces in a particular industry.

										Figures are based on WorkSafe claims from injuries that involve ten or more days off work or more than several hundred dollars of medical costs (the actual figure is adjusted annually).

										Injuries that are not captured in WorkSafe claims data, such as injuries to self-employed people and volunteers or injuries such as long-term industrial disease do not appear on the safe@PTJ.

										<p>These solutions are the minimum that a typical workplace would be expected to have in place. They are limited by what is reasonably practicable for your business. In many instances better solutions can reasonably and practicably be put in place.</p>

										<p>Each workplace varies and very few fall exactly on the average. The reality is many workplaces have no or almost no injuries. The Safe@PTJ shows the overall picture across an industry, sector, occupation or activity and is based on WorkSafe's claim system and the observations of WorkSafe inspectors.</p>

										<p>Some injuries are not common enough to create an accurate percentage; however they have still been identified as important and have therefore been included in the Injury Hotspots tool.</p>
